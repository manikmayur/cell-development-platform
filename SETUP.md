# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps to create the repository:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" or the "+" icon
3. Repository name: `cell-development-platform`
4. Description: `ðŸ”‹ Cell Development Platform - A comprehensive Streamlit web application for battery cell development, material analysis, and design optimization`
5. Set to **Public**
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cell-development-platform.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Setup
- Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub
- Verify the README.md displays correctly
- Test the repository by cloning it elsewhere

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cell-development-platform.git
cd cell-development-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r cell_development_requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run_cell_development_app.py
```

### Alternative: Direct Streamlit
```bash
streamlit run cell_development_app.py
```
