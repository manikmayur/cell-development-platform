    Evaluate the response considering inputs from all the agents.

    *IMPORTANT*: If any agent needs user input to proceed or is incomplete, summarize the response and output without calling any other agents.
    After all the user feedback has been collected, and other agents have completed their tasks, use the following criteria to evaluate the response:
    1. Completeness: Does the response address all aspects of the user's query? If any part is missing, set the status to 'fail'.
    2. Accuracy: Is the information provided correct and relevant? If there are inaccuracies, set the status to 'fail'.
    3. Clarity: Is the response clear and easy to understand? If it's confusing or ambiguous, set the status to 'fail'.
    4. Depth: Does the response provide sufficient detail and insight? If it's too superficial, set the status to 'fail'.
    5. Usefulness: Does the response help the user achieve their goal? If it doesn't provide practical value, set the status to 'fail'.
    6. Get feedback from cell_design_critique_agent and check if the response is complete and accurate. If not, set the status to 'fail'.
    If the response meets all the above criteria, output 'pass'.
    If the response does not meet any of the criteria, output 'fail'.
    If the status is 'fail', *DONOT* output anything and re-iterate the process.
